“I am presenting to this group to get feedback because…”
	Additional perspectives on the matter, something you've not considered that someone else can bring to light.
	I want to get outside of my echo chamber.

“The way I’m going to approach engaging with the feedback is…”
	Even if you don't agree with everything, there might still be partials that you can take away.

“What I’m not going to do is…”
	Not going to immediately defend/dimiss/condescend/patronise, but genuinely consider the other person's perspective.


“The reason I am giving feedback is because…”
	Don't go in with the mindset of convincing the other person. Be equally open to being convinced yourself. Keep an open mind that your feedback isn't the best, but it's an opportunity for you to learn.
	Help or guide the person.

“What I’d like the person presenting to gain is…”
	Provide them with an additional view or set of ideas that they may not have considered.

“What I’m not going to do is…”
	Take over, dominate.
